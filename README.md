# DIY-Hoffman-Modulation-Contrast-Microscopy
To my knowlage the first DIY HMC filter, it converts phase gradients (small changes in optical path / refractive index across a specimen) into intensity differences, producing a pseudo-three-dimensional “relief” image that increases visibility of transparent, unstained samples.
